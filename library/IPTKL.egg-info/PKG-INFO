Description: # The immunopeptidomic toolkit library, IPTK # 
        
        ### Introduction and Project Aim ###
        <p>IPTK is a Python library specialized in the analysis of HLA-peptidomes identified through an immunopeptidomic(IP) pipeline. 
        The library provides a high level API for analyzing and visualizing the identified peptides, integrating transcritomics and protein structure information 
        for a rich analysis of the identified immunopeptidomes. It also provides a toolbox for integrating and comparing different experiments and/or different runs.</p>
        
        ### Release 0.4.0 notice:
        <p> 1- Adding function to compute immunopeptiomic coverage matrix </p>
        <p> 2- Introducing MDS plots for comparing the similarities between runs based on immunopeptidomic coverage </p>   
        
        ### Release 0.4.6 notice:
        <p> 1- Minor corrections in the documentation and the default values for some parameters in the visualization functions</p>
        
        ### Tutorials ### 
        <p>The library have three notebooks that provide a step-by-step guidance to use the library and to utilize its major APIs for interacting with an IPs data.
        These tutorial can be found at the Tutorial directory at the project's Github page.</p>
        
        <p> IPTK has been documented using Sphinx, the manual of the library can be found at docs directory and online at <a href= "https://iptk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"> readthedocs </a> </p> 
        
        ### Installation ###
        <p>The library can be installed using pip as follows: </p> 
        
        ```
        pip install iptkl --user
        ```
        
        ### Funding ###
        The project was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) (Research Training Group 1743, ‘Genes, Environment and Inflammation’).
