# The immunopeptidomic toolkit library, IPTK # 

### Introduction and Project Aim ###
<p>IPTK is a Pythonic library specialized in the analysis of HLA-peptidomes identified through an Immunopeptiomics pipeline. 
The library provides a high level API for analyzing and visualizing the identified peptides, integrating transcritomics and protein structure information 
for a rich analysis and for comparing different experiments and different runs.</p> 


### A high Level summary ### 
The following figure shows the major components of the library and how they interact with each other.  

### Tutorials ### 
<p>The library have five notebooks that provide a step be step guidance to use the library and to utilize its major API for interacting an IPs data.
These Tutorial can be found at the Tutorial directory</p>

<p> IPTK have be documented using doxygen, the manual of the library can be found at TBD </p> 


### Installation ###
<p>The library can be installed using pip or conda as follow: </p> 

```
 pip install  TBD
 ```

 or through conda at 
 ```
 conda install -c bioconda TBD
 ```

### Funding ###
The project was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) (Research Training Group 1743, ‘Genes, Environment and Inflammation’)
