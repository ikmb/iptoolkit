Analyzing, Visualizing, Comparing and Integrating Immunopeptidomics data!

Introduction:
=============
IPTK is a Python library specialized in the analysis of HLA-peptidomes identified through an immunopeptidomic(IP) pipeline. 
The library provides a high level API for analyzing and visualizing the identified peptides, integrating transcriptomics and protein structure information 
for a rich analysis of the identified immunopeptidomes. It also provides a toolbox for integrating and comparing different experiments and/or different mass-spectrometry 
runs. 

Installation:
===============
The library can be installed using 

```
pip install iptkl --user 
```

Funding:
========
The project was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) (Research Training Group 1743, ‘Genes, Environment and Inflammation’).
