        # The immunopeptidomic toolkit library, IPTK # 
        
        ### Introduction and Project Aim ###
        <p>IPTK is a Pythonic library specialized in the analysis of HLA-peptidomes identified through an Immunopeptiomics pipeline. 
        The library provides a high level API for analyzing and visualizing the identified peptides, integrating transcritomics and protein structure information 
        for a rich analysis and for comparing different experiments and different runs.</p>   
        
        ### Tutorials ### 
        <p>The library have three notebooks that provide a step be step guidance to use the library and to utilize its major APIs for interacting with an IPs data.
        These Tutorial can be found at the Tutorial directory</p>
        
        <p> IPTK have be documented using Sphnix, the manual of the library can be found at docs directory and online @readthedocs[will be added after submission] </p> 
        
        
        ### Installation ###
        <p>The library can be installed using pip as follow: </p> 
        
        ```
         pip install  TBD
         ```
        
        
        ### Funding ###
        The project was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) (Research Training Group 1743, ‘Genes, Environment and Inflammation’)
